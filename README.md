# analysis-of-chatData
**A simple chat analysis:** 
In this project I am trying to plot a graph, which shows the frequncy of a chat that I had on facebook with a person "x".
Don't worry the data is secure.

# The json file build: 
```json
  {
    "participants":
    [
      {"name":"x"},
      {"name":"z"}
    ],
    "messages":[
      {
        "sender_name" : "x",
        "timestamp_ms" : "1234567677",
        "content" : "content",
        "type": "generic OR share"
      },
    ],
  }
```
# The result:
